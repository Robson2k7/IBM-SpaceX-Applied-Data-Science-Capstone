Project background and context

SpaceX is a leader in the space industry, known for groundbreaking achievements such as the first successful recovery of a rocket from low Earth orbit by a private company in December 2010. One of the key elements of SpaceX's strategy is to reuse rockets through safe first stage landings, significantly reducing launch costs.
The standard launch cost of a Falcon 9 rocket is $62 million, which is significantly cheaper compared to offerings from other companies (whose costs can exceed $165 million). The big savings come from rocket reusability, but this depends on the success of the first stage landing.

Therefore, the goal of the project is to analyze the factors affecting landing success and develop predictive models. Successful prediction of landing results can be valuable both to SpaceX and to competing companies considering entering the space market. The analysis includes aspects such as payload mass, launch site location, orbit type and the use of advanced analytical methods such as classification models.
